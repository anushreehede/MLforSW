# MLforSW

### Running instructions 
1. Import the libraries   
`pip install numpy`  
`pip install imblearn`  
`pip install scipy`  
`pip install pandas`  
`pip install matplotlib`  

2. Data and results stored in `/data`

3. Source code stored in `/src`

4. Other folder consists of testing code

### Classifiers Used
1. Linear Regression   
2. Naive Bayes Gaussian (same as diagonal quadratic) [theory??]  
3. Generalized linear model
4. Decision Tree
5. Extreme Learning Machine (linear kernel) 
6. Extreme Learning Machine (polynomial kernel) 
7. Extreme Learning Machine (RBF kernel)

### Final Results
Found in the `data` directory as CSV files, PDF files and xlsx files. 

### Rough Work

1. 7 sets of metrics selection techniques

1) Table style
For each project
	For Accuracy and AUC
		For each feature selection, make table and compare
		CL1 CL2 ... CL7
Without 
Fold1
Fold2
.
.
Fold5

With
Fold1
Fold2
.
.
Fold5

2) ???
Make boxplot, for the AUC results. Descriptive statistics - results tabulation - write insights. 

3) Wilcoxon-test analysis 
How different are the feature selection technques?

Replace al NaN with 0. <- model does not exist.

----------------------------------------------------

Think of how to do the remaining 3 comparisons, you can do it!

2. Classification


3. Sampling
